                        In addition to questions of broader applicability, and as appropriate to the type of
                        Program, the Center should describe how it carries out cancer research relevant to its
                        catchment area. This refers to more than accrual to the center’s clinical trials. Cancer
                        research that addresses the catchment area could include research projects that
                        address: problems affecting racial and ethnic minorities, rural residents, women,
                        children, elderly, persons of low socioeconomic status, cancer sites of high
                        incidence/mortality, environmental exposures, behavioral factors, or other issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This does not mean that Centers should study only cancer research important to their
                        catchment area, but that Centers should include such research in their larger portfolio
                        of cancer research addressing questions of national and international importance. NCI
                        has no metric as to how much of a Research Program’s research should address the
                        catchment area, but it is expected that most cancer research is relevant to a broader
                        population than exists in any center’s catchment area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the Research Programs, cancer research relevant to the catchment area
                        should also be discussed in Senior Leadership and Organizational Capabilities.

                        Not all programs are expected to address cancer research relevant to the center’s
                        catchment area. Basic research programs have not generally been expected by
                        reviewers to carry out catchment area-relevant research, although if a basic program
                        does so, it’s certainly a strength that should be described in the application and site
                        visit. However, reviewers have generally expected to see research relevant to the
                        catchment area in the population science programs and programs that have a
                        substantial clinical trials effort.

                        It is noted in the FOA that clinical research studies of rare cancers may have
                        relatively small or slow accrual. This includes studies of rare molecular subtypes of
                        more common cancers. CCSG reviewers should make allowances for this. A link is

                        No. The credentials of a Staff Investigator will continue to be an important review
                        criterion and therefore a specific candidate must be proposed. However, if a change in

                        Shared resources will be discussed and voted on by group, not individually. The
                        review will be based on the review criteria in the FOA, using the full range of merit
                        descriptors available. A group of shared resources may receive one merit
                        descriptor (e.g., excellent) or a range (e.g., excellent to outstanding). Voting per

                        the individual shared resource scores (merit), and there is no predetermined ranking
                        of shared resources value in a group; rather, merit will be determined by the relative
