            <p class="sectionHead">I. Purpose</p>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Office of Cancer Centers (OCC) and Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) are pleased to announce the creation of  officially approved Identity Badges (see Figures below) for NCI-Designated Cancer Centers (CC) and NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCC) to indicate their affiliation with NCI without compromising each center’s own unique institutional identity. These Identity Badges <u>replace</u> the previous CC/CCC graphics that were provided by the NCI OCC.</p>
            <hr />

            <p class="sectionHead">II.	Appropriate Use of the NCI-Designated CC and CCC Badges</p>
            <p>NCI-Designated Cancer Centers and NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers will be allowed to use their respective NCI CC or NCI CCC Identity Badge in the promotion, advocacy, educational, and other related activities of their individual cancer center.</p>
            
       <p style="margin-left: 20px"><b>Please Note:</b> The Badges are the only NCI identity elements that may be used. NCI/NIH grantees, including NCI CCs and NCI CCCs, may not use the NCI, NIH, or HHS logos on any materials or products.  This restriction extends to all Cancer Center-produced materials, documents, or products, whether print material (e.g. pamphlets, brochures, flyers, fact sheets, training materials, books, slide presentations, and conference posters or exhibits), Internet and Intranet websites, or in slides or other electronic presentations, even if the materials, program, or studies are supported by NCI grants.</p>
        
        <p>The institutions allowed to use the NCI CC/CCC Identity Badges include P30 Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) awardees, their primary hospital(s), and other research institutions that are officially peer-reviewed and approved by IRG Subcommittee A (Parent Committee) in accordance with the CCSG Guidelines criteria on consortium centers.  In the latter case, consortium centers must use the appropriate CC or CCC badge in conjunction with the official grantee’s logo or have a text line attributing credit to the grantee’s institution (e.g., a part of the ____________________ NCI-Designated Cancer Center).  Any allowable use of the badge by these affiliates of a CCSG grantee (as defined above in this paragraph) is at the discretion of the CCSG grantee,  only if the CCSG grantee is willing to (1) provide appropriate files and guidelines and (2) monitor the use by such affiliates for adherence to ALL of the terms stated throughout this document and provided that each affiliate agrees to the terms of such use via a signed document between the CCSG and the affiliate.</p>
        
        <p>Authorization to use the CC or CCC Identity Badge is contingent on adherence to all terms of this document and the guidelines and the terms of your CCSG status, as well as adherence by your affiliated institutions as specified above.</p>

        <p>Your organization’s subcontractors/affiliates outside of the range of institutions specified above may NOT use the NCI CC/CCC Identity Badges on their websites, materials, or products.</p>
        <hr />

        <p class="sectionHead">III.	Presentation of the CC and CCC Identity Badges</p>
        <p>Alterations and enhancements to the CC and CCC Badges are not permitted; the Badges are complete as presented in the files, including the version with the text below.  Please adhere to the following terms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The colors of the badge may not be changed.</li>
            <li>A badge may not abut another graphic or text box; a reasonable clearance space must surround the badge to reinforce that it is separate from adjoining items (see clearance and space below).</li>
            <li>A badge may not be superimposed over another graphic or over text.</li>
            <li>A badge may not be used in combination with another graphic or text to create a new graphic.</li>
            <li>A badge may not be distorted by manipulation in width or length to fit into a predetermined space/shape.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If in doubt about the Badge’s presentation on any material or product, you can easily receive guidance by emailing a draft to the NCI OCC at <a href="mailto:ncicenters-r@mail.nih.gov">ncicenters-r@mail.nih.gov</a></p>
            <hr />

        <p class="sectionHead">IV.	Obtaining the Identity Badge Files</p>
        <p>Upon NCI OCC receipt of a signed <a href="~/documents/CancerCentersIdentityBadgeTermsofUse-508C.pdf" target="_blank">agreement</a> to these terms, OCC will provide to the designated public affairs/communications department of the CCSG grantee electronic files of the appropriate Badge.  The files will be of the horizontal and vertical versions in formats suitable for use on websites and other digital materials and for print materials, which require high-resolution.</p>
        <p>The named office serving as the recipient of the files will (1) provide institution-wide/network-wide oversight and control of the files to ensure that use of the Identity Badge adheres to all terms stated in this document by not only the CCSG grantee but by all other allowable affiliated organizations in your network to which you have granted extended use, and (2) serve as the contact for requests for files from other offices within your organization and from affiliated organizations.  The designated office will receive the following file formats:  Graphics applications - .eps, .tif; Word processing - .bmp, .png, .jpg; Web sites - .gif, .jpg.</p>

            <hr />

            <p class="sectionHead">V.	Technical specifications </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Color: The NCI-Designated Cancer Center badge is provided in the following color variations:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Full Color – This is the primary badge and should be the one used whenever possible to maintain a strong brand presence.  It generally looks and works best on a clean, white background.  A solid gray (20% black or lighter) background or lighter is also permissible.  Example: light colored rails or footers </i></li>
                <li><i>White – This reverse-out version should be used on top of vivid colors or colors darker than 40% black.  Example: dark colored footers</i></li>
                <li><i>Grey – should be used sparingly, and looks best on a clean, white background.  A solid light gray (20% black or lighter) background is also permissible.  Example: light colored footers</i></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>


        <ul>
            <li>Sizing and Clearance:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Size - The badges are provided in a number of sizes to help accommodate a variety of needs.  These sizes should be considered minimum sizing.  If scaling or large sizes are needed, vector EPS and SVG versions are available that will scale infinitely without degradation. </li>
                <li>Clear Space – To avoid visual interference and clutter, a minimum clearance of at least 0.25 inches or 18 pixels should be maintained between the badge and any other graphic elements.</li>
            </ul></ul>

            <p><b>Questions regarding the use of the NCI-Designated Center logos may be directed to:<br /></b>Office of Cancer Centers, National Cancer Institute, (240) 276-5600 or email <a href="ncicenters-r@mail.nih.gov">ncicenters-r@mail.nih.gov.</a></p>
